                <p>This is the first annual Cloud Computing Conference at
                    Lehman College. The conference series will feature keynote talks,
                    special sessions, poster presentation, tutorials, workshops,
                    and contributed papers.</p>
                <p>The goal of the conference is to be a premier venue for
                    researchers and industry practitioners to share new ideas,
                    research results and development experiences in various fields.
                    This will be one of a kind in the Bronx.</p>

                    <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services, from
                        applications to storage and processing power. Cloud computing relies on
                        sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale.
                        Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows
                        companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs.
                        Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows
                        enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with
                        improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams
                        to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable
                        demand, providing the burst computing capability: high computing power at
                        certain periods of peak demand.</p>

                    <p>Iâ€™m Edwin Saenz. I am a Business management student at Lehman College of the City
                    University of New York. I am in my last semester. I have no experience with HTML and
                    CSS because I chose this class to learn about because I think it is something important to know
                    because it can help me in the future. I am taking CMP 128 because I believe that everyone should
                    be able to create websites in this modern era and that we all should have basic knowledge of
                    programming.</p>
